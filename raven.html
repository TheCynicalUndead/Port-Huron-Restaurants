		A cozy cafe in downtown Port Huron, MI. This cafe features various artists and their works, of different types. They have a library of books for sale! It's the perfect place for anyone who enjoys their coffee with a good book. The Raven patrons regularly leave notes in the tables and journals. They have an <a href="https://ravencafeph.com/coffee-table-confessional/">online gallery</a> of the notes that had to be thrown out, due to overflowing. <br>

		"I wish this gem wasn't so far away from me.  Although maybe it's a good thing it is. ðŸ˜Š<br>
We stopped in for coffee and dessert. Our waitress was very outgoing and friendly, made great recommendations, and dressed/presented our desserts beautifully. The Raven has such a cool vibe. There is so much to look at, read, and chat about while waiting for your food.<br>

If you have no idea what to order, just ask. I don't think you will be disappointed. I'm looking forward to our next trip there and enjoying more of their wonderful food/coffee"<br>- Jenn Ooten, 3 months ago, 5 stars<br>

		"This cafe has got to be one of my favorite spots in Port Huron. I went in recently and picked up their Cider Supreme and a light lunch of Mushroom and Brie with a Bruschetta and it was an incredible experience. Everything felt made with care. And especially on a Tuesday, the staff was kind and efficient, and it showed with our meal. If youâ€™re ever in town, stop in for a good meal or one of their thousands of books and board games to make your time here unforgettable.<br>

Kid-friendliness: Board games for the more energetic, classic childrenâ€™s literature for the more reserved, and a great view of the Michigan/Canadian river border should be enough to keep any kid entertained for family groups.<br>

Wheelchair accessibility: Ramped entrance into the main hall is a bonus, not sure if thereâ€™s an alternative way to the upper levels but could be a unique addition! You wonâ€™t be missing out on its charm in either case."<br>- Justin LaBelle, 2 weeks ago, 5 stars
